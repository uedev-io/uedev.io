**Note:** This page is still a work in progress. There are a lot of meta
specifiers still to document!

Unreal's [USTRUCT Specifiers](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/ProgrammingAndScripting/GameplayArchitecture/Structs/Specifiers/)
page lists all of the core specifiers but a lot of the metadata specifiers that
it lists are only usable with UCLASS.
