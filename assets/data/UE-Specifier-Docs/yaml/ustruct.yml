    comment: |
      "Split Struct Pin" is an option available when right-clicking the return node of a `UFUNCTION`. It is only available if all the variables within the struct are exposed to blueprints, and if `DisableSplitPin` is not present in the USTRUCT definition.
  
      Why you might want to use it is a more interesting question. The only example of this being used in the codebase is with `FGameplayTag`. Gameplay tags are structs but only contain an `FName` property that is used as their ID. I suppose that `DisableSplitPin` is used because Epic wanted to discourage users from splitting the struct out to `FName` when it's much more helpful to keep it as an `FStruct` and use all the helper functions within.

      `HasNativeBreak` lets you specify a static `UFUNCTION()` to use instead of the default behavior when a user chooses "Break (Struct)"
  
      By default all properties marked as `BlueprintReadOnly` or `BlueprintReadWrite` would be present in the node. Defining a native break function can let you customize what is present in that node.

        USTRUCT(BlueprintType, meta = (HasNativeBreak = "ExampleProject.CatHelperLibrary.BreakCatStruct"))

      Similar to `HasNativeBreak`, `HasNativeMake` allows you to specify a `static` `UFUNCTION()` to use to create and fill the values of a struct, without having to make the values within the struct `BlueprintReadWrite`.
